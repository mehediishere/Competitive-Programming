Week-1 ::: Day-1
Topic: Fundamentals.

Prerequisite: 
* Use C language for your program.
* Use codeblocks for coding.
* Use .cpp extension in every file.
* Use scanf and printf for input and output.
* Do not use an extra header file which is not necessary for your code.
* Do not use bits/stdc++.h library.

Note: Sorry, we don't provide any tutorial for today. Because we don't find any suitable tutorial for all of these topics together. So please do topic wise google search for learning in a better way with optimizing your time. At the end of the day please ensure yourself about you have some correct ideas about all of the following topics. Thank You.

Topics for learning - 
1. Learn about Bit and byte.
2. What is variable in C.
3. Data types in C with their format specifier, size, range, declaration, and input-output format. (Suggested data types - int, double, char, bool, long long).
4. When to use which types of data. How to print a specific number of digits after the decimal point for a double data type.
5. Differences between int, double, and char.
6. Differences between int and long long. When to use which.
7. Learn about C operators. (Tutorial link - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_operators.htm). 
8. How to swap values between two variables in C. 
9. Learn about keywords in C.
10. Difference between increment and decrement operator. Example: ++x and x++.
11. Learn about ASCII values in C. Must remember the ASCII values of (A-Z, a-z, 0-9).
12. Learn about typecasting in C. How to convert integer values to doubles and vice versa.
13. How to comment codes in C.
14. How to declare global variables.
15. How to declare const values in C/C++. Learn about the #define directive.
16. Learn using these keywords. (sqrt, pow, powl, swap, max, min, abs, INT_MAX, INT_MIN, LLONG_MAX, LLONG_MIN).

Assignment:
1. Write a C program that takes three valid side lengths of a triangle as input. You must take inputs at integer data type. Print the area of that triangle with three digits after decimal point. Do typecasting if necessary.

MINIMUM=MEDIUM=MAXIMUM=1.

Explanation For Problem_1:
Given three side of a triangle x,y and z. Print the area of that triangle with three digits after decimal point.
If x=12,y=10 and z=8 then the corresponding output is: 39.686.

Test Case For Problem_1:
Input_1:
35 25 15
Output_1: 
162.380 

Input_2:
7 5 4
Output_2: 
9.798

Input_3:
90 77 66
Output_3: 
2481.591

Input_4:
2 3 4
Output_4: 
2.905

Input_5:
100 99 101
Output_5: 
4329.261
